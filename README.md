## TASK DESCRIPTION

The objective of this task was to write and implement a C program that demonstrates a basic data compression algorithm known as Run-Length Encoding (RLE). This task was undertaken to gain practical knowledge of file handling, string processing, and algorithm implementation in C programming. The deliverable of this task is a tool that can compress and decompress text files efficiently.

Data compression is an important technique used to reduce the size of data for storage and transmission. Run-Length Encoding is one of the simplest lossless compression algorithms, which works by replacing consecutive repeated characters with a single character followed by the number of its occurrences. This makes RLE especially effective for text files that contain repeated characters.

In this task, the program first reads data from an input text file and performs the compression operation. The input file is opened in read mode, and characters are processed one by one. When consecutive identical characters are detected, their count is maintained and written to a compressed output file in encoded form. This demonstrates how file reading and writing operations can be combined with logical conditions to implement an algorithm.

The program also includes a decompression feature. During decompression, the compressed file is read and decoded by expanding each character according to its stored count. The decompressed output is written to a new text file, ensuring that the original content is accurately restored. This confirms that the compression technique used is lossless in nature.

Proper file handling techniques such as checking file pointers, opening files in appropriate modes, and closing files after use were followed throughout the program. Functions were used to separate compression and decompression logic, making the program modular, readable, and easy to maintain. Clear console messages were displayed to inform the user about the completion of compression and decompression processes.

This task helped in understanding the practical application of algorithms in real-world scenarios such as data storage optimization and file processing. It also strengthened concepts related to loops, conditionals, file I/O functions, and memory-efficient programming in C.
